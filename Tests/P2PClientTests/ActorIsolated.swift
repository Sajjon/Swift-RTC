/// A generic wrapper for isolating a mutable value to an actor.
///
/// This type is most useful when writing tests for when you want to inspect what happens inside
/// an effect. For example, suppose you have a feature such that when a button is tapped you
/// track some analytics:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Dependency(\.analytics) var analytics
///
/// func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> EffectTask<Action> {
///   switch action {
///   case .buttonTapped:
///     return .fireAndForget { try await self.analytics.track("Button Tapped") }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///     
/// Then, in tests we can construct an analytics client that appends events to a mutable array
/// rather than actually sending events to an analytics server. However, in order to do this in
/// a safe way we should use an actor, and ``ActorIsolated`` makes this easy:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// func testAnalytics() async {
///   let store = TestStore(â€¦)
///
///   let events = ActorIsolated<[String]>([])
///   store.dependencies.analytics = AnalyticsClient(
///     track: { event in
///       await events.withValue { $0.append(event) }
///     }
///   )
///
///   await store.send(.buttonTapped)
///
///   await events.withValue { XCTAssertEqual($0, ["Button Tapped"]) }
/// }
/// ```
@dynamicMemberLookup
public final actor ActorIsolated<Value: Sendable> {
  /// The actor-isolated value.
  public var value: Value

  /// Initializes actor-isolated state around a value.
  ///
  /// - Parameter value: A value to isolate in an actor.

    self.value = value

  /// Perform an operation with isolated access to the underlying value.
  ///
  /// Useful for inspecting an actor-isolated value for a test assertion:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let didOpenSettings = ActorIsolated(false)
  /// store.dependencies.openSettings = { await didOpenSettings.setValue(true) }
  ///
  /// await store.send(.settingsButtonTapped)
  ///
  /// await didOpenSettings.withValue { XCTAssertTrue($0) }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameters: operation: An operation to be performed on the actor with the underlying value.
  /// - Returns: The result of the operation.

  ) async rethrows -> T {
    var value = self.value
    defer { self.value = value }
    return try await operation(&value)
  }

  /// Overwrite the isolated value with a new value.
  ///
  /// Useful for setting an actor-isolated value when a tested dependency runs.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let didOpenSettings = ActorIsolated(false)
  /// store.dependencies.openSettings = { await didOpenSettings.setValue(true) }
  ///
  /// await store.send(.settingsButtonTapped)
  ///
  /// await didOpenSettings.withValue { XCTAssertTrue($0) }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameter newValue: The value to replace the current isolated value with.
  public func setValue(_ newValue: Value) {
    self.value = newValue
  }
}

/// A generic wrapper for turning any non-`Sendable` type into a `Sendable` one, in an unchecked
/// manner.
///
/// Sometimes we need to use types that should be sendable but have not yet been audited for
/// sendability. If we feel confident that the type is truly sendable, and we don't want to blanket
/// disable concurrency warnings for a module via `@preconcurrency import`, then we can selectively
/// make that single type sendable by wrapping it in ``UncheckedSendable``.
///
/// > Note: By wrapping something in ``UncheckedSendable`` you are asking the compiler to trust
/// you that the type is safe to use from multiple threads, and the compiler cannot help you find
/// potential race conditions in your code.
